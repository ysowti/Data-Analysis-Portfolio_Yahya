# Data Analysis Projects

# Stock Market Analysis

In this project I look at data from stock market, particularly some technology stocks. I use pandas to get stock information, visualize different aspects of it, and finally look at a few ways of analyzing the risk of a stock, based on its previous performance history. I also predict future stock prices through Monte Carlo method.

# 2016 Presidential Election Data Analysis

In this data analysis project I am looking at data from 2016 election and analyze two datasets. The first dataset I analyze is the results of aggregated political polls to answer some questions like the party affiliation of people being polled, the effect of undecided polls, change of polls sentiment over time and the effect of debates on polls. The second dataset I use is donors dataset to statistically analyze the donation amount and see how it differs between candidates and parties, trying to find demographics of donors and to find patterns in donation amounts.
